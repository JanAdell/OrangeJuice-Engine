# Orange Juice Engine
Repository dedicated to the development and releases of our home brew engine, Orange Juice. This project is an assignment for the 3D Engines subject at the Videogame Design and Development degree (CITM, UPC). The engine is created with C++ and other major libraries such as OpenGL and ImGui.

## How to Use

### Controls
* **WASD** Keys for camera movement
* **Spacebar** to bring the camera up
* **Left Control** to bring the camera down
* **Mouse Wheel** to zoom in and out
* **ALT + Left mouse click** to rotate the camera
* **F key** to focus on an object and orbit around it

### General Use

Just download our latest release either in our repositorie's releases page or clicking [here](https://github.com/JanAdell/OrangeJuice-Engine/releases), unzip the file, and execute **OrangeJuice_Engine.exe**.

From there feel free to play around with the UI, load any models (either the ones on the Assets folder or your own) or do any action you want. Feel free, if you encounter an error, to report it [here](https://github.com/JanAdell/OrangeJuice-Engine/issues).

### Known errors

Some specific FBX models might not load into the engine due to their version. Loading them into 3DS Max and reimporting to a newer version allows for them to be seen in the engine.

### Future Implementation

* Allow the user to move the models in the scene either through inspector or with their mouse if the object is selected. We wanted to allow position changes on this first release, but it was giving us serious problems, so we have decided to leave it as something for display only, and work to have it ready as intended for the next release.
